This Power BI project provides a comprehensive view of MTA ridership trends during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Through effective data modeling, DAX calculations, and intuitive visualization, the dashboard delivers insightful analysis to understand transit recovery and rider behavior over time.
The ridership analysis shows steady recovery across the MTA system, but the pace varies by mode. Subways and Buses are rebounding fastest, indicating a need to prioritize service reliability and capacity planning on these routes. Slower recovery in Access-A-Ride and Staten Island Railway suggests opportunities to reassess service levels, improve efficiency, or explore alternative mobility options.
Using these trends, leadership can make data-driven decisions to adjust service schedules, reallocate resources to high-demand areas, and implement targeted campaigns or incentives to boost ridership where recovery lags. This positions the MTA to strengthen operations and accelerate systemwide recovery.
